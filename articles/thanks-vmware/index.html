I want to tell you about the most valuable experience I had; it&rsquo;s the one thing that I can <strong>never</strong> thank VMware <em>enough</em> for.</p><hr><h2 id=a-bumpy-arrival>A bumpy arrival</h2><p>In early 2012, I was the CTO of a failing start-up that I co-founded. Money had dried up; I had to let go of everything.</p><p>I had recently emigrated to the USA from the UK, and my (ex) wife was divorcing me because she had fallen in love with another man she had met while I was trying to build a business.</p><p><strong>Flat-broke</strong>, <strong>burned out</strong>, <strong>heartbroken</strong>, <strong>abandoned</strong>, and generally feeling quite sorry for myself.</p><p>I needed something <strong><em>completely new</em></strong> in my life; I needed a <strong>new career</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=a-search-for-hope>A search for hope</h2><p>I saw a job posting that I thought I would be good at on the <a href=https://careers.vmware.com/main/>VMware careers website</a>, and I applied. VMware was a brand I knew well, and I used consumer products as a developer for a while.</p><p><em>Weeks and weeks</em> went by without hearing anything. Having built recruitment and candidate management systems before, I just knew my application had gone into a <strong>black hole</strong>.</p><p>Giving up hope, I started looking elsewhere, and then one afternoon, I got an email from a VMware recruiter. It was about a completely different role, but after a couple of interviews with some duff companies - <strong>it was most uplifting</strong>.</p><hr><p>My interview experience was great; I was grilled by eight people over eight hours on the phone.</p><p>I got a coding test from (who is now) one of VMware&rsquo;s most respected Principal Engineers, and then I was flown to Palo Alto for a whole day of interviews.</p><p>I wore <strong>cowboy boots</strong> and tried to style my facial hair like <strong><em>Wolverine</em></strong>. I wanted people to at least <em>remember me</em>.</p><p>I was offered a <strong>Staff Engineer</strong> position a few days later.</p><p>My Journey at VMware was about to begin, and my mutton chops must have been the key to landing the gig.</p><hr><h2 id=dave-meet-dave>Dave, meet Dave.</h2><p>I was <strong><em>flat</em></strong> broke. VMware told me to fly to Cambridge, MA, for my first day to meet my new (remote) team.</p><p>I <strong>had to borrow</strong> the money for the flight and the hotel; I didn&rsquo;t want VMware to know I was on my knees.</p><hr><p>On my first day, I was introduced to a <em>giant</em> man named <strong>Dave Gress</strong>.</p><p>A Senior Staff Engineer and old-school assembly and C hacker, I watched this man debug software by literally <strong><em>watching the processor</em></strong>. I had never seen such a skill.</p><p>That evening, Dave invited me for a whiskey. We talked long into the night and enjoyed multiple rounds of liquid fire. I was not used to spending company money; it was a real treat.</p><p>I <strong><em>really</em></strong> liked Dave; he <strong>understood</strong> me.</p><hr><h2 id=the-beginning-of-my-life>The beginning of my life.</h2><p>Dave has a daughter. Her name is <strong>Michelle</strong>, and she also worked at VMware.</p><div class="terminal-alert warning-box">Legend has it that she was one of only a few people that knew how to get <a href=https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.esxi.install.doc/GUID-DC5D6EA2-2F17-4CB0-A0DB-C767F2BE2FBA.html>Autodeploy on ESXi</a> to work correctly.</div><p>My first introduction to her was when Dave told me to message her on Skype and ask her about something to do with a &lsquo;<strong><em>Mechanical Bull at a bar in Palo Alto</em></strong>&rsquo;.</p><p>Michelle promptly responded:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who are you? do I know you?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>And then she <strong>blocked me</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=welcome-to-the-gang>Welcome to the gang.</h2><p>Dave and the team were <strong><em>laughing</em></strong> their asses off at me.</p><p>As the new guy, <strong>I had been pranked!</strong> And most likely (<em>unknowingly</em>) committed some kind of HR violation on my <strong>first-day</strong>, no less.</p><p>A few weeks later, I was in Palo Alto, and we had gathered for an on-site all-hands with my new team.</p><p>One lunchtime, I was preparing to leave the conference room we were sitting in, and then I saw Michelle for the first time as she walked past me.</p><p>She <strong><em>smiled</em></strong> at me.</p><hr><h2 id=wow-that-girl-thats-the-girl>Wow, that girl, that&rsquo;s the girl!</h2><p>My eyes <strong>lit up</strong>, and my <strong><em>heart skipped a beat</em></strong>; <strong>She was beautiful</strong>.</p><p>Flying home, I <strong><em>could not get her out of my mind</em></strong>. I could not stop thinking about my co-worker&rsquo;s <em>hot daughter</em>.</p><div class="terminal-alert terminal-alert-error">This was going to be an issue.</div><hr><div class=terminal-card><header>The big risky decision</header><div><p>I <strong><em>wanted</em></strong> to be with her, and I didn&rsquo;t even know her, and I just had a feeling she would understand me. She grew up with a hacker for a father, and she too worked in high-tech. She <em>knew the game</em> and <strong>understood the universe</strong> I lived in.</p><p>This conclusion was assuming she would be interested in me back, so this is all me daydreaming like an arrogant and egotistical fool at this point.</p><p>Nonetheless, I was going to try and <strong>win her heart</strong>.</p></div></div><hr><p>At VMworld San Francisco 2012, I got to talk to her face to face for a few minutes. We talked about our dogs, and I had two pups, and she had a big beautiful Doberman named Magnum.</p><p><strong>I was enraptured with her</strong>.</p><p>We didn&rsquo;t see each other again after that for a couple of months, not until VMworld in Barcelona.</p><hr><h2 id=time-to-make-a-move>Time to make a move</h2><p>After drinks on the roof-top pool and lots of all my (<strong><em>most excellent</em></strong>) lines, I asked Michelle back to my hotel room for a whiskey&mldr; <strong>she agreed to</strong>.</p><div class="terminal-alert terminal-alert-primary">I should point out here that Michelle absolutely <strong>HATES</strong> whiskey. I discovered this a while later.</div><p>I <strong>kissed the girl</strong>. And she <strong><em>kissed me back</em></strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=the-adventure-begins>The adventure begins.</h2><p>We were <strong><em>convinced</em></strong> we were being discreet. However, the <strong>entire team</strong> had seen us <em>disappear</em> together and <em>re-appear</em> together the next day. This <strong>included Dave</strong>, her father.</p><p>I must admit, it was <strong><em>more</em></strong> than a bit awkward walking into the NOC (Network Operations Center) that morning with Dave, <strong>he knew</strong>, and <strong><em>I knew that he knew</em></strong>.</p><p>Dave Gress is a <strong>big</strong>, solid man, 6 foot 7 inches tall. I am <strong><em>literally</em></strong> a foot shorter than him.</p><p>I nervously fumbled the words:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dave, I want to&mldr;&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>He interrupted me:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Stunned, I stuttered:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Are&mldr; Are you OK with&mldr;&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>He interrupted again:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;You two are perfect for each other.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><hr><p>A <strong>giant grin</strong> rose from his face, and then he gave me a friendly &lsquo;<strong><em>pat</em></strong>&rsquo; on the back.</p><p>However, due to the man&rsquo;s &lsquo;<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wreck-It_Ralph>Wreck-It Ralph-esque</a>&rsquo; stature,
it can often feel more like being hit with a tree trunk.</p><h2 id=that-day-was-the-moment-my-life-began>That day was the moment my life began.</h2><p>VMware had given me more than I had expected and more than I could have hoped for.</p><p>I asked Dave for his permission to marry Michelle at <strong>RADIO</strong> (<em>VMware&rsquo;s annual internal R&D Conference</em>) in 2014.</p><div class=terminal-card><header>Another grin appeared across his face&mldr;</header><div>He said <strong>yes</strong>.</div></div><hr><h2 id=michelle-and-i-got-married-in-2015>Michelle and I got married in 2015.</h2><figure class=inline-figure><a href=https://quobix.com/articles/thanks-vmware/wedding.png><img src=https://quobix.com/articles/thanks-vmware/wedding.png title="Michael Jackson showed up!
