mainly social media, and <strong>terrible</strong> cable news networks like <a href=https://www.foxnews.com>Fox News</a> and <a href=https://www.cnn.com>CNN</a>.</p><p>The outcome led to events like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit>Brexit</a> and the
<a href=https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/24-months-january-6-attack-capitol>January 6th Capitol Attack</a> â€” a <strong>pivotal point in history</strong>
for the modern world.</p><p><strong><em>None of which is new</em></strong>. What happened in 2016 has <strong>happened before</strong>, <strong>many times</strong>, and across the ages.</p><div class="terminal-alert terminal-alert-primary">But something was a little different this time around.</div><hr><h2 id=zero-interest-rate-phenomena>Zero interest rate phenomena.</h2><p>From 2010 through 2015, the world existed <strong><em>outside of reality</em></strong>.</p><p>Money was essentially <strong>free</strong>, meaning anyone could borrow cash and pay <em>very little</em> interest on the loan.</p><p>This rare situation created a distortion bubble in reality. Somehow businesses and companies were valued on growth,
accumulating users, and &lsquo;<a href=https://amzn.to/3Y0uByv>blitzing</a>&rsquo; markets with a saturating presence.</p><p>During that period, companies <em>derived valuation</em> came from <strong>growth</strong>. In other words, It was about how quickly
a company could go to market with a product, <strong>saturate the market</strong> with a brand, and operate a
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner-take-all_market>winner takes all</a> strategy to capture the market.</p><h2 id=stranger-things>Stranger things</h2><p>It was even <strong><em>stranger</em></strong> than just growth alone.</p><p>It seemed that any business that took a traditional, <strong>non</strong>-technical product
(<em>like a hotel room, taxi, or delivery service</em>) and wrapped it in a technical solution that <strong><em>removed</em></strong> having to
talk to people, or it added a sense of higher convenience, exclusivity, and novelty <strong>(mostly novelty)</strong> over that traditional product.</p><p>Everyone suddenly became a bit starstruck by that concept.</p><blockquote><p>&mldr;&ldquo;yeah, but - does it have an app?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><hr><p>The product and the end-to-end experience of the product became an <strong>afterthought</strong>.</p><p>It was about showcasing how &lsquo;<strong>disruptive</strong>&rsquo; a start-up or company was and how it could <strong>dominate</strong> a new market.</p><p><a href=https://uber.com>Uber</a>, <a href=https://airbnb.com>Airbnb</a>, and <a href=https://www.doordash.com>Doordash</a> market themselves as
the <em>re-invention</em> or <strong><em>disruption</em></strong> of Taxis, Logistics, Hotels, and Takeout food.</p><p>They all took <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman>Reid Hoffman&rsquo;s</a> &lsquo;<a href=https://amzn.to/3Y0uByv>Blitzscaling</a>&rsquo;
approach to business. It worked like <strong>nothing</strong> we had ever seen during that magical time.</p><p>By the time 2016 rolled around, however, everyone wanted a slice of the pie. The money was <strong><em>everywhere</em></strong>,
and it was <strong>free</strong>.</p><h2 id=peak-noise-to-signal-ratio>Peak noise-to-signal ratio</h2><p>Social Media was a hive of insanity (<em>not that it&rsquo;s much better today, but wow, back then, Facebook was a cesspit</em>)</p><p>We saw the rise of concepts like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth>flat-earth</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon>Qanon</a>.
Utterly insane ideas generally relegated to the internet&rsquo;s darkest corners were <strong><em>suddenly shoved in everyone&rsquo;s faces</em></strong>.</p><p>Truth suddenly became an opinion. Somehow <strong>logic</strong> and <strong>reason</strong> started leaking out of reality.</p><p>We didn&rsquo;t know it then, but this is where <strong><em>things tipped</em></strong>. We were about to experience a taste of the new world ahead of us.</p><hr><h2 id=wiping-off-the-groceries>Wiping off the groceries</h2><p>In 2020, the world <strong>froze</strong>, and we all experienced something new (<em><a href=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/1918-pandemic-history.htm>well, for most of us under the age of 100</a></em>).</p><p>The pandemic <strong>changed our lives completely</strong>.</p><p>All of a sudden, we found ourselves wearing masks everywhere. Stores were closed, lockdowns were in place,
<strong><em>alien</em></strong> concepts to most of us in the &lsquo;free&rsquo; world.</p><div class="terminal-alert terminal-alert-error">I remember standing in the kitchen, <strong>wiping off the delivery groceries with disinfectant and a mask</strong> to protect my family from the dangerous virus.</div><blockquote><p>I have since had COVID twice, as has my entire family.

unlike anything we had seen before. All of this was new territory for everyone.</p><div class="terminal-alert terminal-alert-primary">Tech was going <strong>insane</strong>!</div><p>Valuations for internet-based companies went through the charts, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354113820_Peloton's_ride_to_growth">Peloton went to the moon</a>

Any company that enabled remote operations or engagement benefited from the bounty bubble.</p><p>Governments worldwide pumped even <strong>MORE</strong> <a href=https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan>free cash into people&rsquo;s hands</a>.</p><div class="terminal-alert terminal-alert-primary">MOAR <strong>FREE MONEY</strong> FOR EVERYONE</div><p>Tech CEOs convinced the world that remote work was the future for everyone (It isn&rsquo;t, and <strong><em>won&rsquo;t be</em></strong>),
and everyone would love video-conferencing from home all day (we don&rsquo;t.

And then, just like in 2000,
we saw the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_bubble>bubble pop</a>.</p><hr><h2 id=here-we-go-again>Here we go again</h2><p>2022 was <a href=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/one-question-looms-about-where-tech-stocks-go-now-after-one-of-their-worst-years-on-record-11672361520>one of the worst, if not the worst, year in history</a>
for technology companies.</p><p>Silicon Valley went through another bubble pop, this time affecting tens of thousands of tech workers, in a <a href=https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-11659373/Tech-jobs-bloodbath-rockets-200-000.html>bloodbath

as a result of the re-balancing of the system. It&rsquo;s not over yet and as of writing, is still in motion.</p><p>The alternate reality we saw from 2020-2022, was being un-made, and it was also the start of a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean>regression toward the mean</a>,
<strong>not just for tech</strong> but for <strong>planet earth</strong>.</p><p>It seems now that people are getting upset with being <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/o2dgag/current_pricingcrazy/>charged crazy fees</a>
to stay in someone else&rsquo;s house and be asked to <a href=https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-chores-cleaning-fee-11663269029>mow the lawn and take home garbage</a>
as part of the deal.</p><p>People are re-discovering novel concepts like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel>paying a business for a fully serviced room</a>,
with complete freedom to come and go, with no strings attached.</p><p>Re-discovering that hotels are pretty convenient and that a taxi is often a more reliable and convenient way to travel
