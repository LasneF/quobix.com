of mine after being bombarded by firehoses of new data and information. It&rsquo;s been a <strong><em>while</em></strong> since I felt it,
but it&rsquo;s <strong>no less awful</strong> than I remember.</p><p>Over the years, I&rsquo;ve learned how to <strong>re-orient my thinking</strong> when that <em>feeling</em> appears.
This article describes how I deal with it and some techniques that might be helpful to you.</p><hr><h2 id=a-big-head>A big head</h2><p>When it comes to being <em>intelligent</em>, you can <strong>always</strong> bet on <strong><em>one thing</em></strong>&mldr;</p><div class="terminal-alert terminal-alert-error">There is <strong>always</strong> someone else <strong><em>more intelligent</em></strong> than you.</div><p>I <em>didn&rsquo;t know this</em> early on in my career. I had an ego the <strong><em>size of a house</em></strong>,
and my internal position was generally:</p><blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> bright; you all need <strong><em>sunglasses</em></strong> to look at me.</p></blockquote><div class=terminal-card><header>What an asshole.</header><div><p>My ego was <strong><em>smashed to bits</em></strong> a good few times, and after having my ass handed to me multiple times,
I <strong>eventually learned</strong>.</p><p>I <strong><em>finally understood</em></strong>.</p><p>Humility is <strong>not weakness</strong>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s <strong><em>strength</em></strong>.</p></div></div><hr><h2 id=the-fear>The fear</h2><p>At some point, we all find ourselves in a position where it seems that everyone around us is
<strong><em>somehow</em></strong> much <strong>more intelligent</strong> than we are.</p><p>It can feel like punching <em>way</em> above our own weight as if we&rsquo;re <strong>out of our depth</strong>.</p><p>The syndrome can be summarized as:</p><div class="terminal-alert terminal-alert-primary">A <strong><em>fear</em></strong> that more competent people will <strong>suddenly discover</strong> that
we&rsquo;re <strong>not as bright</strong> as they thought.</div><p><strong><em>Imposter syndrome</em></strong> attributes that we have only been successful because <strong>we got lucky</strong>.</p><p>It also manifests as the feeling of having <strong><em>deceived</em></strong> others into thinking we&rsquo;re more intelligent or
skillful than we really are.</p><div class="terminal-alert warning-box">This is <strong>despite</strong> evidence to the contrary.</div><hr><h2 id=its-ok>It&rsquo;s OK.</h2><p>First of all… if you feel this way - I want you to know that <strong>you&rsquo;re normal</strong>.</p><div class="terminal-alert success-box">You&rsquo;re <strong>not an impostor</strong>.</div><p>The fact that you&rsquo;re able to feel inadequacy demonstrates <strong>humility</strong>. Humility is a <strong><em>crucial</em></strong> component of emotional
intelligence, also known as <strong>EQ</strong>.</p><p>Emotional intelligence and developing it will be <strong><em>critical</em></strong> to level up into those higher career ranks.
It&rsquo;s essential to become a better <strong>leader</strong>, <strong>influencer</strong>, or just a <strong>better friend</strong>.</p><p>An excellent way to visualize imposter syndrome is to imagine knowledge and the knowledge of others
around us as <strong><em>spheres</em></strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=spheres-of-knowledge>Spheres of knowledge</h2><p>When we&rsquo;re new to a company or a team in an unfamiliar domain, we tend to imagine everyone around us with these
<strong><em>giant</em></strong> bubbles of <strong>knowledge</strong> around them, and our bubble is <strong><em>puny</em></strong> and <strong><em>unworthy</em></strong>.</p><figure class=inline-figure><a href=https://quobix.com/articles/impostor-syndrome/what-we-think.png><img src=https://quobix.com/articles/impostor-syndrome/what-we-think.png title="What we often think our knowledge and ability looks like compared to others around us" alt></a><figcaption>What we often think our knowledge and ability looks like compared to others around us</figcaption></figure><p>The fear another will &lsquo;<strong><em>discover</em></strong>&rsquo; that we&rsquo;re <strong>not as competent</strong> as we should - can be intense.</p><p>Simply being asked to contribute can almost drive us to avoid interaction with others,
shying away from answering questions or even participating in projects.</p><p>The fear of being seen as <strong><em>inferior</em></strong> can be challenging to overcome.</p><p>The reality is that everyone around us has bubbles of knowledge that <strong>overlap with ours</strong>; they know things <strong><em>we don&rsquo;t</em></strong>
and <strong><em>vice versa</em></strong>, like a Venn Diagram.</p><hr><h2 id=we-all-overlap>We all overlap</h2><figure class=inline-figure><a href=https://quobix.com/articles/impostor-syndrome/what-it-looks-like.png><img src=https://quobix.com/articles/impostor-syndrome/what-it-looks-like.png title="The reality is that our knowledge and experience all overlaps" alt></a><figcaption>The reality is that our knowledge and experience all overlaps</figcaption></figure><p>They may have <strong><em>super-specialized</em></strong> knowledge about a set of technologies that we have a very light comprehension of. Still, they may know <strong>nothing</strong> about the technologies and techniques we do.

Even though two people may be <em>colleagues</em>,
at the <em>same level</em>, they are <strong><em>not equal</em></strong>.</p><p>Everyone&rsquo;s skills and experiences are <strong>different</strong>, which means we hold knowledge in many other areas from one another.</p><p>When we combine <strong><em>diverse</em></strong> <strong>knowledge</strong>, <code>amazing</code> things happen.</p><p>When we accept different people bring different values to the table, the importance of
diversity and inclusivity become clear.</p><hr><h2 id=a-few-steps-away-from-having-no-idea>A few steps away from having no idea</h2><p>It&rsquo;s easy to forget the <strong>depth</strong> and <strong><em>breadth</em></strong> of our <em>own</em> skills and experience when being impressed
by what <strong><em>others</em></strong> bring to the table.</p><p>Everyone around us is mostly figuring things out as <strong>they go along</strong>; rarely does anyone have the
<strong><em>detailed</em></strong> knowledge required to handle a new situation.</p><div class="terminal-alert terminal-alert-primary">Everyone is generally just a <strong><em>few</em></strong> steps from having <strong>no idea</strong> what to do.</div><p>Almost everyone is affected, from interns to the most seasoned CEOs.</p><p>When a senior leader says &ldquo;<strong><em>I don&rsquo;t know</em></strong>,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s not them declaring weakness; it is, in fact, an invitation
for others to step up and contribute knowledge to the community.</p><p>Saying &ldquo;<strong><em>I don&rsquo;t know</em></strong>&rdquo; is how we all become more experienced, wiser, and more valuable.</p><hr><h2 id=the-dunning-kruger-graph>The Dunning Kruger graph</h2><p>I used to suffer from this syndrome <strong>a lot</strong>. I went through the <strong><em>Dunning Kruger Graph</em></strong> multiple times.</p><p>Dunning Kruger <em>hypothesizes</em> that people with <strong><em>low</em></strong> experience in a domain often <strong>overestimate</strong> their skills and ability.
Often with <strong>high</strong> confidence, it&rsquo;s a good illustration of the idea of <strong><em>illusory superiority</em></strong>.</p><p>During the pandemic, people with <strong>no</strong> medical or scientific training <strong><em>suddenly</em></strong> became
&lsquo;<strong>experts</strong>&rsquo; in immunology. This is a <em>perfect</em> example of the concept.</p><div class=terminal-card><header>Some context behind my relationship with Impostor Syndrome</header><div>I <strong>never went to college</strong>, so I <strong><em>taught myself</em></strong> computer science and software engineering.</div></div><p>I always felt like I was <strong>much</strong> less knowledgeable when talking to other engineers early on.</p><p>My constant &lsquo;<strong><em>flight</em></strong>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<strong><em>fight</em></strong>&rsquo; reflex engaged, so I don&rsquo;t make a fool of myself,
has caused me to <strong>ruin</strong> the armpits of many a shirt over the years.</p><figure class=inline-figure><a href=https://quobix.com/articles/impostor-syndrome/dunning-kruger.png><img src=https://quobix.com/articles/impostor-syndrome/dunning-kruger.png title="Some people never move past the peak" alt></a><figcaption>Some people never move past the peak</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id=yeah-i-got-this---oh-no-wait>Yeah, I got this - oh, no, wait&mldr;</h2><p>The Dunning Kruger theory states that confidence <strong><em>rapidly rises</em></strong> as we learn a new set of skills.
However, it can only grow so much before reaching the <strong>peak of stupidity</strong>.</p><p>Once a <strong><em>certain</em></strong> amount of expertise has been gained, the reality is that we actually know very little about
what it is we think we know. This is also generally the point where we can <strong><em>overly</em></strong> estimate our capabilities.</p><p>When we plow on and learn more about something and become more proficient in the art of it,
our confidence <strong>starts to drop</strong>. The drop varies in steepness, depending on <strong><em>how high</em></strong> up on mount stupid we are.</p><p>For me, this is when impostor syndrome <strong>kicked in the hardest</strong>.
I used to feel like I was <strong>half good</strong> at something, that I was <strong><em>actually a fraud</em></strong> compared to others.</p><p>Unfortunately, this feeling generally got <strong><em>worse</em></strong> as I learned more. Which resulted in feeling <strong>even more,</strong> fraudulent.</p><hr><h2 id=bottoming-out>Bottoming out</h2><p>After a while in the pit of despair, <strong>something starts to happen</strong>.</p><p>Patterns begin to appear. Problems we have seen before and know how to solve.</p><p>This starts to <strong>reverse the trend</strong>, and confidence begins to rise quickly again.
Becoming fluent in those patterns and eventually <strong><em>becoming an expert</em></strong>.</p><div class="terminal-alert success-box">Learning about the existence of this curve helped me <strong>conquer my impostor syndrome</strong>.
When I felt like a fraud, I knew I was actually <strong>right on target</strong>.</div><p>If we feel like an impostor, it generally means that we&rsquo;re <strong><em>smart enough</em></strong> to have gone <strong>past</strong> the peak of stupidity.
We have slid down the other side and realized the true scope and scale of the art.</p><p>To beat this feeling? <strong>Just keep going</strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=treating-failure-as-another-form-of-education>Treating failure as another form of education.</h2><p>Experience is essentially having made <strong><em>enough mistakes</em></strong> to know how to fail at something. Edison said:</p><blockquote><p>I didn&rsquo;t fail; I just found 2000 ways not to make a light bulb.</p></blockquote><p>Applying experience is how we become <strong><em>successful</em></strong> in <strong>not</strong> failing.</p><p>Feeling like an impostor is <strong><em>just a reminder</em></strong> that you&rsquo;re on the <strong>right path</strong> and there is <strong><em>more</em></strong> to learn.</p><p>So just <strong><em>keep going</em></strong>. Keep <strong>training</strong>, keep <strong>learning</strong>, keep <strong>practicing</strong>.</p></section><hr><nav class=go-back-parent-link><a href=https://quobix.com/articles/>&lt; Back to Articles</a></nav></article></main></div><footer class=footer><a href=https://quobix.com/author>Dave Shanley</a> 2007-2022
