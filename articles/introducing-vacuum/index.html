I was floating in the ether, looking for gaps, holes, anything that I could
fill up with and hide for a while so that I could collect my thoughts.</p><hr><h2 id=a-stranger-with-a-smile>A stranger with a smile</h2><p>One afternoon in February or March, a gentleman named <em>Akmal Khan</em> approached me. Akmal has over 40 years of engineering
and leadership experience.</p><p>We started talking, and <strong><em>instantly connected</em></strong> - his brain <strong>worked like mine</strong>.</p><p>Within a week, we were whiteboarding all kinds of crazy concepts, we didn&rsquo;t have a mission, but we had buckets of invention ideas.</p><div class=image-grid><figure class=image-grid-item><a href=https://quobix.com/articles/introducing-vacuum/whiteboard-1.png><img src=https://quobix.com/articles/introducing-vacuum/whiteboard-1_hu53902bc38ccd083ba4f2d86166b66ef2_675490_285x0_resize_box_3.png width=285 height=350 title="Exploratory Architectures" alt="Image of a whiteboard with sketches and scribbles"></a><figcaption>Exploratory Architectures</figcaption></figure><figure class=image-grid-item><a href=https://quobix.com/articles/introducing-vacuum/whiteboard-2.png><img src=https://quobix.com/articles/introducing-vacuum/whiteboard-2_hu53902bc38ccd083ba4f2d86166b66ef2_499258_285x0_resize_box_3.png width=285 height=350 title="Random Ideas" alt="Image of a whiteboard with sketches and scribbles"></a><figcaption>Random Ideas</figcaption></figure><figure class=image-grid-item><a href=https://quobix.com/articles/introducing-vacuum/whiteboard-4.png><img src=https://quobix.com/articles/introducing-vacuum/whiteboard-4_hu53902bc38ccd083ba4f2d86166b66ef2_453129_285x0_resize_box_3.png width=285 height=350 title="What if we...?" alt="Image of a whiteboard with sketches and scribbles"></a><figcaption>What if we...?</figcaption></figure></div><h2 id=the-gap>The gap</h2><p>As we became friends and spent hours thinking out loud and drawing, a new initiative blipped on my radar:
<a href=https://www.vmware.com/products/vmc-on-aws/>VMware Cloud on AWS.</a></p><p>Suddenly a flood of new REST APIs popped up, and we needed a cloud console to wire up all these APIs. Luckily the engineering team had chosen <a href=https://www.openapis.org/>OpenAPI</a> to document the APIs.</p><p>Akmal and I started looking at ways to automatically consume the <a href=https://www.openapis.org/>OpenAPI</a> specifications and create code for the UI.</p><p>We quickly realized that the Open Source landscape for OpenAPI was <strong><em>pretty bad</em></strong>.</p><p>Frankly, the landscape was <strong>awful</strong> (back then). There were tools for generating code (but the code was garbage), and there were tools
for documentation that wasn&rsquo;t very good at all.</p><p>There were also tools to validate / lint the specifications, but they were not performant or valuable.</p><hr><h2 id=the-opportunity>The opportunity</h2><p>We realized that investing in building bullet-proof <a href=https://www.openapis.org/>OpenAPI</a> tools would help us accelerate and dramatically reduce developer toil and bugs.</p><p>Akmal started coding like crazy, building low-level libraries and code generators that worked much better (and still do) than most tooling on the market.</p><p>It was successful! It worked and allowed me to step things up significantly with <a href=https://www.openapis.org/>OpenAPI</a> at VMware.</p><hr><h2 id=project-eve>Project EVE</h2><p>Fast forward to Summer 2019. It was the before times, before COVID - life was good. I had put together a pitch deck with
<a href=https://www.mynameisjehad.com>Jehad Affoneh</a>, in which we explained how we could re-imagine all the developer tools, docs, and experiences by adopting the <a href=https://www.openapis.org/>OpenAPI</a> Standard.</p><p>I pitched it to SVPs and GMs, who all bought into it; everyone did; it was a no-brainer. <strong>We got funded</strong>!</p><p>We called it Project EVE with a public-facing name of <a href=https://twitter.com/vmwaredx>VMware DX</a></p><p>The first tool to build was a valuable linter for <a href=https://www.openapis.org/>OpenAPI</a> that we could use in our higher-level tools to measure
quality. We looked at the market and tried out <a href=https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral>Spectral</a> but quickly learned it wasn&rsquo;t suitable.</p><hr><h2 id=javascript-is-excellent-but-its-not-for-everything>JavaScript is excellent, but it&rsquo;s not for everything</h2><p><a href=https://stoplight.io>Stoplight</a> built <a href=https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral>Spectral</a> in JavaScript. We started feeding in our enterprise-grade,
super large, and complex OpenAPI Specs into Spectral. 10-30 seconds later, we would get a result.</p><p>Thousands and thousands of warnings and errors made no sense and no idea how to fix them or why.</p><p>The experience was <strong>poor</strong>, to be honest—slow and <strong><em>mostly spewing noise</em></strong>.</p><hr><h2 id=it-turns-out-building-a-fast-helpful-linter-is-hard>It turns out building a fast, helpful linter is hard</h2><p>After three months, the team <strong>abandoned the linter</strong>. It just <em>wasn&rsquo;t working</em>, and it <strong><em>wasn&rsquo;t adding any value</em></strong>.</p><div class="terminal-alert terminal-alert-primary">It kept on blowing up or giving unhelpful results.</div><p><strong>We failed hard</strong>. I was personally <strong><em>very disappointed</em></strong>, and I had done an inferior job of setting the right vision.
If I knew then what I know now, things would be very different for that tool.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the <strong>most critical</strong> element that a quality analysis engine needs. We needed to know the specification as a compiler does.</p><p>Without this component, I <strong><em>knew we would hit performance issues down the road</em></strong>.</p><p>We decided to pivot to focus on the next most important thing - documentation. More on that another day; for now, continuing
to use <a href=https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral>Spectral</a> for linting was our only option.</p><blockquote><p>Le sigh.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=the-debt-comes-due>The debt comes due</h2><p>A year later, in early 2021, the rest of Project EVE is <strong>going well</strong>. We have built some excellent tools, one of which is called the
<strong><em>Printing Press</em></strong>, which powers very large-scale <a href=https://www.openapis.org/>OpenAPI</a> documentation for VMware.</p><p>We had launched new <a href=https://developer.vmware.com/apis/vsphere-automation/latest/>API docs</a> and <a href=https://developer.vmware.com/powercli>PowerCLI</a>
docs, all generated from EVE tooling. Looking good!</p><p><strong><em>But, it wasn&rsquo;t all good.</em></strong></p><hr><p>I started working on some new services that depended on <a href=https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral>Spectral</a>.
These were <em>real-time</em> experiences, and <strong>speed</strong> was a <strong><em>hard requirement</em></strong>.</p><p><a href=https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral>Spectral</a> could not do what I needed it to do. Large specs <strong>choke</strong> the tooling.</p><p>There was no other option at the time -
however, <a href=https://redocly.com/docs/cli/>ReDocly</a> has a much faster option for linting. <a href=https://redocly.com/docs/cli/>ReDocly</a>
still suffers from the same problems at scale that <a href=https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral>Spectral</a> does.</p><p>The technical debt <strong><em>I knew would come to bite</em></strong> had created a barrier with no way around it, and I didn&rsquo;t have the time or
the resources to solve the problem the way it is needed.</p><div class=terminal-alert>If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about EVE, you can watch this talk I gave at <a href=https://techfieldday.com/>Tech Field Day</a> 10</div><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0_9AqIOugk style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><hr><h2 id=if-you-want-something-done>If you want something done</h2><p>VMware built all the EVE tooling in golang with my direction. Without a golang linter that ran at least <strong>1000x</strong>, the speed of
<a href=https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral>Spectral</a>, there was <strong><em>no way</em></strong> to execute my vision.</p><p>In October 2021, I decided to <em>roll up my sleeves</em> and do the hard work, on my <strong>own</strong> time, on <strong>my dollar</strong>. No-one else
was going to fund the effort, except me.</p><p>I started building the linter I knew was required to accomplish many higher-level goals for OpenAPI tooling.</p><p>One requirement was that the tool is a <strong>drop-in replacement</strong> for <a href=https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral>Spectral</a>.</p><hr><h2 id=how-hard-can-it-be>How hard can it be?</h2><p>The deeper I went, I realized that I had more and more problems to solve. Building a fully featured, extensible schema
linter from the ground up is not easy at all.</p><p>I had to build the <a href=https://json-schema.org/>JSON Schema</a> resolver <strong>four times</strong>. My designs were unstable and slowed
down with scale.</p><p>My code <strong><em>didn&rsquo;t hold up to testing</em></strong>, mainly because of the potential for highly recursive graph data structures.
I stood in my kitchen at night <em>scratching my head</em> on many evenings, trying to figure it out.</p><p>My <a href=https://quobix.com/articles/impostor-syndrome/>impostor syndrome</a> was in full swing, and I slid into <a href=https://quobix.com/articles/impostor-syndrome/#the-dunning-kruger-graph>the pit of despair</a>.</p><p>There were multiple points where I felt like <strong><em>I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing</em></strong>, and I almost quit twice.
It took me months and thousands of tests to get it right. The solution was to <strong>change strategy</strong> and use an index design.</p><p><a href=https://quobix.com/vacuum/api/spec-index/>Learn more about how I solved the speed problems</a> using an index.</p><hr><h2 id=ten-months-later>Ten months later</h2><p><div class="terminal-alert success-box">vacuum is now <strong>ready</strong>, and she is the <strong><em>fastest</em></strong>, most comprehensive OpenAPI linter on the planet.</div>But don&rsquo;t take my word for it; try it with one of your OpenAPI specs below.</p><p><vacuum-online></vacuum-online></p><blockquote><p>If you need a spec to try out, why not use the <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/main/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml>Petstore Example</a></p></blockquote><hr><p>vacuum is fully compatible with, yet <strong><em>exponentially faster</em></strong> than <a href=https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral>Spectral</a>.</p><p>There are also unique features available in vacuum that aren&rsquo;t available anywhere else, like a
