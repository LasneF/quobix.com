After recently joining Splunk, I got to experience a bit of an old nemesis of mine after being bombarded by firehoses of new data and information. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I felt it, but it&amp;rsquo;s no less awful than I remember.
Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to re-orient my thinking when that feeling appears. This article describes how I deal with it and some techniques that might be helpful to you.</description></item><item><title>Hello, Splunk!</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/hello-splunk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 14:19:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/hello-splunk/</guid><description>A distinguished engineer Today I started a brand new role at Splunk. I&amp;rsquo;ve joined as Distinguished Engineer in the Security group as UI Architect of SaaS Applications.
In 1997 I founded hack-net.com (don&amp;rsquo;t visit the site). It was one of the most significant security-related websites on the internet for a while. We used to get millions of visitors a week and had 20+ contributors on the platform.

We&amp;rsquo;re going to build a simple
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with STOMP, it stands for (S)imple (T)ext (O)riented (M)essaging (P)rotocol. It&amp;rsquo;s a straightforward but stable protocol that makes interacting with a message or event-based APIs a breeze.</description></item><item><title>Thank you, VMware.</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/thanks-vmware/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 08:06:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/thanks-vmware/</guid><description>This is my story about the most incredible time I had at VMware. I want to tell you about the most valuable experience I had; it&amp;rsquo;s the one thing that I can never thank VMware enough for.
A bumpy arrival In early 2012, I was the CTO of a failing start-up that I co-founded. Money had dried up; I had to let go of everything.
I had recently emigrated to the USA from the UK, and my (ex) wife was divorcing me because she had fallen in love with another man she had met while I was trying to build a business.</description></item><item><title>How to create a streaming AsyncAPI microservice using golang.</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/asyncapi-streaming-using-golang/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 13:07:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/asyncapi-streaming-using-golang/</guid><description>Watch the video If you want to learn more about AsyncAPI, head over to AsyncAPI.com and find out more about the standard and the power it provides us.

I had been working for VMware for around eight months.
I was excited to be working (finally) in Silicon Valley; A dream of mine since childhood.
One wintery afternoon, Mornay Van Der Walt Called me into his office. He asked me
&amp;ldquo;Do you think we could build a prototype that installs and configures an entire SDDC in a hyper-converged infrastructure appliance format and do it in under 15 Minutes&amp;rdquo;?</description></item><item><title>TrashBox, Engineering a solution to memory loss.</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/trashbox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 15:23:07 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/trashbox/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Dammit, why am I unable to get this under control!&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself as I ran, dragging two weeks worth of hot, stinking garbage toward the collection truck that was just about to drive past my house again.
It&amp;rsquo;s late August in Virginia in 2017, which isn&amp;rsquo;t great for storing garbage outside your house. My wife is newly pregnant and understandably losing her patience with me.
Hot and annoyed at myself, I reach for my pocket (and remember I&amp;rsquo;m still in my underpants), suddenly it dawns on me:</description></item><item><title>What is Experience Engineering?</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/experience-engineering/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 13:07:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/experience-engineering/</guid><description>OK, so I know I just said that it&amp;rsquo;s an actual term. It&amp;rsquo;s a term that I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of made up. It is, however, composed of real things that all revolve around designing and building experiences.
More than just user interface It&amp;rsquo;s easy to default to &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;oh you mean UI, right?&amp;rdquo; when talking about engineering experiences.
The reality, however, is the term &amp;lsquo;UI&amp;rsquo; means more than a browser-based application. UI goes way beyond that.</description></item></channel></rss>
