Now, if you do care about sexy productivity tools for developers, then read on. I have something to share with you.
But before I do, let me ask you three questions:
Can you answer yes to these questions? Question 1:
Do you know if your UI/client sends the correct data to your backend/API?</description></item><item><title>Introducing openapi-changes</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/introducing-openapi-changes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 08:19:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/introducing-openapi-changes/</guid><description>You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking, &amp;ldquo;wow what a boring name&amp;rdquo;.
I know it&amp;rsquo;s boring. It&amp;rsquo;s also the best thing I could come up with.
All the other tools with similar functionality (but nowhere near as sexy) had already taken all the variations I could come up with.
So, I named it literally. Boring, but practical! Like a minivan.
Except this minivan has a bar and a disco inside it, with room for 100 of your friends.</description></item><item><title>How to check your API is compliant with an OpenAPI specification</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/openapi-compliance-testing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 05:19:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/openapi-compliance-testing/</guid><description>This is a walkthrough of how you can check the compliance of an OpenAPI specification against a client (like a UI, CLI, or SDK) and server or actual API endpoint.
We will use an application called wiretap.
Watch the video This video will walk you through the steps of checking the compliance of an OpenAPI specification against a client and server.
What is wiretap? wiretap is an API compliance testing tool that allows us to &amp;rsquo;tap-into&amp;rsquo; requests and responses between clients and servers and validate that those requests and responses comply with the OpenAPI specification defined.</description></item><item><title>How to check for breaking changes in an OpenAPI specification</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/openapi-changes-walkthrough/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 03:19:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/openapi-changes-walkthrough/</guid><description>I assume you&amp;rsquo;re trying to compare an original and an updated spec or want to check a single spec against a previous commit in a Git repo.
We will use an application called openapi-changes.

It&amp;rsquo;s time to get some actual work done, finally! I&amp;rsquo;m excited about coding and being productive for a change.
My brain is engaged. I am in the zone and in a state of flow. I can see the matrix.
My phone buzzes in my pocket 30 minutes into my session.
It&amp;rsquo;s a Slack message.
Immediately my entire train of thought is interrupted, like a record needle scratching across an in-motion record.</description></item><item><title>Rise of the builder</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/rise-of-the-builder/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 11:17:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/rise-of-the-builder/</guid><description>As we knew it, the world stopped operating according to standard operating procedures in 2016.
And then, suddenly, it came to a complete halt in 2020.
What happened in 2016? We reached a boiling point in the west driven by the extreme left and right politics that dominated media outlets, mainly social media, and terrible cable news networks like Fox News and CNN.
The outcome led to events like Brexit and the January 6th Capitol Attack â€” a pivotal point in history for the modern world.</description></item><item><title>How to give a better demo</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/demo-tips/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2023 05:19:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/demo-tips/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to level up your skills as a software engineer, one thing you need to pay attention to is the importance of giving a great demonstration of new features or code that you&amp;rsquo;ve created.

I had just exited the M.A.R.V.I.N project at VMware and was a little lost.
I had no mission and no goals. I was floating in the ether, looking for gaps, holes, anything that I could fill up with and hide for a while so that I could collect my thoughts.
A stranger with a smile One afternoon in February or March, a gentleman named Akmal Khan approached me.</description></item><item><title>How to beat Impostor Syndrome</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/impostor-syndrome/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 10:46:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/impostor-syndrome/</guid><description>Ah, we meet again, my old friend. After recently joining Splunk, I got to experience a bit of an old nemesis of mine after being bombarded by firehoses of new data and information. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I felt it, but it&amp;rsquo;s no less awful than I remember.
Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to re-orient my thinking when that feeling appears. This article describes how I deal with it and some techniques that might be helpful to you.</description></item><item><title>Hello, Splunk!</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/hello-splunk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 14:19:38 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/hello-splunk/</guid><description>A distinguished engineer Today I started a brand new role at Splunk. I&amp;rsquo;ve joined as Distinguished Engineer in the Security group as UI Architect of SaaS Applications.
In 1997 I founded hack-net.com (don&amp;rsquo;t visit the site). It was one of the most significant security-related websites on the internet for a while. We used to get millions of visitors a week and had 20+ contributors on the platform.

It&amp;rsquo;s a straightforward but stable protocol that makes interacting with a message or event-based APIs a breeze.</description></item><item><title>Thank you, VMware.</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/thanks-vmware/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 08:06:56 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/thanks-vmware/</guid><description>This is my story about the most incredible time I had at VMware. I want to tell you about the most valuable experience I had; it&amp;rsquo;s the one thing that I can never thank VMware enough for.
A bumpy arrival In early 2012, I was the CTO of a failing start-up that I co-founded. Money had dried up; I had to let go of everything.
I had recently emigrated to the USA from the UK, and my (ex) wife was divorcing me because she had fallen in love with another man she had met while I was trying to build a business.</description></item><item><title>How to create a streaming AsyncAPI microservice using golang.</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/asyncapi-streaming-using-golang/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 13:07:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/asyncapi-streaming-using-golang/</guid><description>Watch the video If you want to learn more about AsyncAPI, head over to AsyncAPI.com and find out more about the standard and the power it provides us.

I had been working for VMware for around eight months.
I was excited to be working (finally) in Silicon Valley; A dream of mine since childhood.
One wintery afternoon, Mornay Van Der Walt Called me into his office. He asked me
&amp;ldquo;Do you think we could build a prototype that installs and configures an entire SDDC in a hyper-converged infrastructure appliance format and do it in under 15 Minutes&amp;rdquo;?</description></item><item><title>TrashBox, Engineering a solution to memory loss.</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/trashbox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 15:23:07 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/trashbox/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Dammit, why am I unable to get this under control!&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself as I ran, dragging two weeks worth of hot, stinking garbage toward the collection truck that was just about to drive past my house again.
It&amp;rsquo;s late August in Virginia in 2017, which isn&amp;rsquo;t great for storing garbage outside your house. My wife is newly pregnant and understandably losing her patience with me.
Hot and annoyed at myself, I reach for my pocket (and remember I&amp;rsquo;m still in my underpants), suddenly it dawns on me:</description></item><item><title>What is Experience Engineering?</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/experience-engineering/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 13:07:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/experience-engineering/</guid><description>OK, so I know I just said that it&amp;rsquo;s an actual term. It&amp;rsquo;s a term that I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of made up. It is, however, composed of real things that all revolve around designing and building experiences.
More than just user interface It&amp;rsquo;s easy to default to &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;oh you mean UI, right?&amp;rdquo; when talking about engineering experiences.
The reality, however, is the term &amp;lsquo;UI&amp;rsquo; means more than a browser-based application. UI goes way beyond that.</description></item></channel></rss>
