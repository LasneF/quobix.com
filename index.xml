It&amp;rsquo;s time to get some actual work done, finally! I&amp;rsquo;m excited about coding and being productive for a change.
My brain is engaged. I am in the zone and in a state of flow. I can see the matrix.
My phone buzzes in my pocket 30 minutes into my session.
It&amp;rsquo;s a Slack message.
Immediately my entire train of thought is interrupted, like a record needle scratching across an in-motion record.</description></item><item><title>falsy</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/functions/core/falsy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 12:39:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/functions/core/falsy/</guid><description>falsy will check that a given JSON Path does not exist, or has been not defined or is empty.

Sometimes we need more power, we need the ability to hook in custom code and custom business logic.
Spectral does a great job with custom functions, So, vacuum has adopted a very similar design, to facilitate custom functions.
Since v0.3.0 vacuum support JavaScript based functions as well as golang based functions. vacuum is written in golang. When building a JavaScript function, we need to remember that the JavaScript code is being read in by vacuum and then parsed and executed by the goja JavaScript engine.</description></item><item><title>OWASP Rules</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rulesets/owasp/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:13:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rulesets/owasp/</guid><description>Apply Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) API rules to your OpenAPI specification using vacuum. Learn more about OWASP.
These rules were written by Ricardo Gra√ßa.
vacuum supports OWASP API rules out of the box!
To use them, you will need to create a ruleset that extends the vacuum:owasp ruleset.
Create a new file (something like owasp-rules.yaml) and add the following YAML to it:
extends: [[spectral:oas, recommended], [vacuum:owasp, all]] This creates a ruleset that implements all of the Recommended Rules and the OWASP Rules.</description></item><item><title>owasp-security-hosts-https-oas3</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/owasp/owasp-security-hosts-https-oas3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:09:43 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/owasp/owasp-security-hosts-https-oas3/</guid><description>All server interactions MUST use the https protocol, so the only OpenAPI scheme being used should be https.

This was actually one of the motivators behind the development of the tool.
If you&amp;rsquo;re a golang developer, and you want to lint OpenAPI specs using a library, then look no further.

lint This will print a summary of your linting results. The lint command will use the Recommended RuleSet.

Every rule would walk through the specification nodes, looking for what ever it is the function does. This worked great, except.. it didn&amp;rsquo;t.
vacuum would slow way down on complex rules like oas3-valid-schema-example.
It slowed down to the point where it was taking seconds to run on very large specs. This was no good.
After a re-think and many prototypes, I designed a simple index that will seek out everything in the specification and hold a reference.</description></item><item><title>All Rules</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rulesets/all/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2022 05:30:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rulesets/all/</guid><description>Want to throw the kitchen sink at your OpenAPI specification? Use All the rules!
To configure all the rules, you can simply use the same mechanism Spectral uses for extending a ruleset.
Create a new file (something like all-rules.yaml) and add the following YAML to it:
extends: [[spectral:oas, all]] This creates a ruleset that extends &amp;lsquo;all&amp;rsquo; rules. You can find this ruleset in the rulesets/examples directory, and it&amp;rsquo;s named all-ruleset.</description></item><item><title>Core Concepts</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/concepts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 12:20:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/concepts/</guid><description>There are three core concepts when it comes to vacuum.
Function Rule RuleSet Functions power Rules and Rules make up RuleSets What are Rules? Rules are filters that define a set of target values you want to check against. Rules define what to look up, where to find it and what to check for. Those options are then sent to a function that will execute that logic.

Open API is the de-facto choice for designing and documenting REST APIs. Following an API First123 strategy allows teams to design and define, test, mock and explore APIs without building any code.
It allows service providers and consumers to work independently, using a strongly defined, rich API contract.

It&amp;rsquo;s critical that all Operation&amp;rsquo;s can be identified independently, without the need to analyze the path, params and verbs to locate an operation.
An operationId is used by documentation tools, code generators and mocking engines. It&amp;rsquo;s used to define page names, URI&amp;rsquo;s and method names in auto-generated code.
It needs to be unique so there are no clashes with other operations (nothing else can share that ID).</description></item><item><title>operation-parameters</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/operations/operation-parameters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/operations/operation-parameters/</guid><description>Operation Parameters can be described through paths, headers cookies and queries.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to ensure that none of these parameters are duplicates, which is easier that you may think, when an operation has multiple parameter definitions across different types.

Tools use tags differently when generating code, or documentation. Sometimes, multiple tags can interfere with how tools operate.

Sometimes, tags that have been defined for an operation, have not been defined as part of the global scope of the specification.
This is technically allowed, however it&amp;rsquo;s Bad OpenAPI hygiene. The rule will throw a warning. Make sure tags used by operations are always defined in the global scope of the document.

Sometimes, they can be defined, but never used, or used but never defined. Sometimes they are duplicated, or set to required, but then are not defined.
There is a whole raft of issues that can appear with Path Parameters, so this rule is one of the more complex ones.
Why did this violation appear?

A RuleSet is a style guide with each rule being an individual requirement as a part of the overall guide.
What does a RuleSet look like? vacuum has based RuleSet configuration on the Spectral Ruleset model. This means Spectral RuleSets are 100% compatible with vacuum1
vacuum has added an id value to the rule (which Spectral does not), this to allow backwards compatibility, and the freedom to rename and add new names to new vacuum only content.</description></item><item><title>What is vacuum?</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 06:25:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/about/</guid><description>vacuum is an ultra-super-fast, lightweight OpenAPI linter and quality checking tool, inspired by Spectral.

Reference Types References come in three forms:
Local references Remote references Relative references Local references Local references are those that are local to the specification being processed. They look something like this:
$ref: &amp;#39;#/components/schemas/Error&amp;#39; They are local in the sense that they are contained within the same document as the reference.</description></item><item><title>linting other documents</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/api/non-openapi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/api/non-openapi/</guid><description>The majority of vaccum is designed for linting OpenAPI. Most of the built in functions and rules are designed for OpenAPI documents.
However, vacuum is built to be extensible, and it is possible to lint other types of documents using the core functions.

Any other object can reference it, to save duplication.
Sometimes schema definitions are never referenced from anywhere, they are &amp;lsquo;unused&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;orphaned&amp;rsquo;.
This could be an oversight, it could be a case where the spec was changed and new schemas have replaced older ones, and those older schema definitions were never removed.
It&amp;rsquo;s good contract hygiene to prune anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t used, out of it.</description></item></channel></rss>
