It&amp;rsquo;s a term that I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of made up. It is, however, composed of real things that all revolve around designing and building experiences.
More than just user interface It&amp;rsquo;s easy to default to &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;oh you mean UI, right?&amp;rdquo; when talking about engineering experiences.
The reality, however, is the term &amp;lsquo;UI&amp;rsquo; means more than a browser-based application. UI goes way beyond that.</description></item><item><title>TrashBox, Engineering a solution to memory loss.</title><link>https://quobix.com/articles/trashbox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 15:23:07 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/articles/trashbox/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Dammit, why am I unable to get this under control!&amp;rdquo; I thought to myself as I ran, dragging two weeks worth of hot, stinking garbage toward the collection truck that was just about to drive past my house again.
It&amp;rsquo;s late August in Virginia in 2017, which isn&amp;rsquo;t great for storing garbage outside your house. My wife is newly pregnant and understandably losing her patience with me.

I just wanted to say, that I am sorry if I have offended you.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t ever a situation in which I am trying to be hurtful, or exert rudeness (I hate both of those things).
If you have experienced emotional distress because of something I did, said or wrote, then please accept my genuine apology ♥️.
Sometimes, I misread intent. Sometimes I forget how brutal even the most innocent words can be, when used in a certain context.</description></item><item><title>Author</title><link>https://quobix.com/author/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 16:50:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/author/</guid><description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Dave Shanley.
I&amp;rsquo;m a software architect, inventor, technical leader, and failed musician.
I have about twenty-five years of experience with designing and building software across various industries and businesses.
My specialty is Experience Engineering, which generally means that I design and build technology that you engage with as a consumer.
I work as a Sr. Staff Engineer at VMware. My role is Architect of Developer Experience (DX).
Making complex things feel simple and intuitive.</description></item></channel></rss>
