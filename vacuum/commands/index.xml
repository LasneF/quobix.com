Working in a terminal is an essential and every day part of any software or DevOps engineer&amp;rsquo;s life. A terminal is perhaps the most common interface most of us use.
Console UIs are not so common these days, which is really strange.
Using a browser based app is cool, but there is something really cool about a console UI.</description></item><item><title>html-report command</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/commands/html-report/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 07:39:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/commands/html-report/</guid><description>Ahh, the traditional generated HTML report. Quite often, they are a real let-down.
I wanted to do something not awful when it comes to the HTML report. vacuum can generate a self-contained interactive UI experience for exploring linting results from an OpenAPI specification, or a vacuum report.
The report has no dependencies, and it makes no network calls. The HTML file that is generated, is fully self-contained, it can be used without an internet connection.</description></item><item><title>spectral-report command</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/commands/spectral-report/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 07:39:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/commands/spectral-report/</guid><description>The spectral-report command will generate a linting report that is the same as the Spectral JSON output. It&amp;rsquo;s a drop-in replacement for any application using Spectral, but wants to go much faster.
vacuum spectral report This will generate a report from your my-openapi-spec.yaml and will save the file as spectral.json
If you leave the optional second argument off, then the default file output of vacuum-spectral-report.json will be used.
Available Flags spectral-report supports the following flags</description></item><item><title>report command</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/commands/report/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 07:39:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/commands/report/</guid><description>The report command will generate a high fidelity recording of a linting run. The report is a replayable data set that can be used to re-render any vacuum report using either the dashboard, or the html-report commands.
The original results are preserved and won&amp;rsquo;t be changed, regardless how many times the report is re-rendered.
vacuum report This will generate a report from your my-openapi-spec.yaml and will save the file as myreport-MM-DD-YY-HH-MM-SS.</description></item><item><title>lint command</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/commands/lint/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 07:39:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/commands/lint/</guid><description>The fastest way to see something useful is to print something out to the console.
lint This will print a summary of your linting results. The lint command will use the Recommended RuleSet.
Just want to try things out? If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an OpenAPI spec and you want to see something, you can run it against one of the test specifications. A good one to try is the petstorev3.</description></item></channel></rss>
