Use All the rules!
To configure all the rules, you can simply use the same mechanism Spectral uses for extending a ruleset.
Create a new file (something like all-rules.yaml) and add the following YAML to it:
extends: [[spectral:oas, all]] This creates a ruleset that extends &amp;lsquo;all&amp;rsquo; rules. You can find this ruleset in the rulesets/examples directory, and it&amp;rsquo;s named all-ruleset.</description></item><item><title>Recommended Rules</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rulesets/recommended/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 05:30:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rulesets/recommended/</guid><description>Want to check against recommended rules?
Recommended rules are the default behavior from vacuum. If there is no ruleset supplied, vacuum will always run recommended rules only.
To explicitly define a &amp;lsquo;recommended only&amp;rsquo; ruleset that can be customized, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to extend a ruleset the same way that Spectral does.
Create a new file (something like recommended-rules.yaml) and add the following YAML to it:
extends: [[spectral:oas, recommended]] This creates a ruleset that extends &amp;lsquo;recommended&amp;rsquo; rules.</description></item></channel></rss>
