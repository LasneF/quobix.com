It&amp;rsquo;s also compatible with existing Spectral rulesets and generates compatible Spectral reports.
vacuum can suck all the lint of a 5mb OpenAPI spec in about 250ms. Designed to reliably lint OpenAPI specifications, very, very quickly. Including very large ones. Spectral. can be quite slow when used as an API and does not scale for enterprise applications.</description></item><item><title>Installing vacuum</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/installing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 06:25:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/installing/</guid><description>1.
