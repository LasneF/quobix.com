Tools use this value when generating code, mocks, tests or documentation. It&amp;rsquo;s important that it&amp;rsquo;s not left out.
Why did this violation appear? The host value is missing, or it&amp;rsquo;s been left empty.
Bad example swagger: 2.0 host: &amp;#34;&amp;#34; paths: /vacuum: ... Good example swagger: 2.0 host: &amp;#34;quobix.com&amp;#34; schemes: - &amp;#34;https&amp;#34; paths: /vacuum: ... How do I fix this violation?</description></item><item><title>oas2-host-trailing-slash</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/oas2-host-trailing-slash/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 14:58:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/oas2-host-trailing-slash/</guid><description>JSON Path: $.host The host value cannot end with a trailing slash. The addition of a slash will create invalid URI&amp;rsquo;s when consumed by tools.
Why did this violation appear? &amp;lsquo;/&amp;rsquo; was found at the end of the host property of the specification.
Bad example host: &amp;#34;quobix.com/&amp;#34; schemes: - &amp;#34;https&amp;#34; paths: /vacuum: ... Will generate quobix.com//vacuum. The double slash comes from leaving it on the end of the host.
Good example host: &amp;#34;quobix.</description></item><item><title>oas3-host-trailing-slash</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/oas3-server-trailing-slash/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 14:58:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/oas3-server-trailing-slash/</guid><description>JSON Path: $.servers[*] The url value cannot end with a trailing slash. The addition of a slash will create invalid URI&amp;rsquo;s when consumed by tools.
why is this rule not recommended? This rule is also covered by the oas3-api-servers rule. If you enable both of these rules, then you will see a &amp;lsquo;double&amp;rsquo; hit. Why did this violation appear? &amp;lsquo;/&amp;rsquo; was found at the end of the url property of the specification.</description></item><item><title>oas2-host-not-example</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/oas2-host-not-example/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 15:58:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/oas2-host-not-example/</guid><description>JSON Path: $.host Sometimes the host contains &amp;lsquo;example.com&amp;rsquo;, added during testing phases.

Unless the user is the owner of &amp;lsquo;example.com&amp;rsquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea to check for this and any other example-type domains used.

Knowing over which HTTP transport an API operates is important for automation and code generation.
A note on HTTP vs HTTPS We should NOT use HTTP in public internet facing APIs. Generally it&amp;rsquo;s OK when used behind a secured API gateway. We should always use HTTPS over HTTP for any public API.</description></item><item><title>contact-properties</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/contact-properties/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/contact-properties/</guid><description>JSON Path: $.info.contact Contact Information should be pretty self-explanatory (I hope). Anyone publishing an OpenAPI contract, should include details of who they are, and how to contact them.
Why did this violation appear? One of more contact details are missing from the contract.
What is this rule checking for? The following properties are checked to ensure they have been defined.
name url email Bad example Missing url and email
info: contact: name: Chicken Nugget Inc.</description></item><item><title>info-contact</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/info-contact/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/info-contact/</guid><description>JSON Path: $.info Contact Information should be pretty self-explanatory (I hope). This rule checks that the contact object has been set on the Information Object
Why did this violation appear? There is no contact object set in the info object. The info object may also be missing.
What is this rule checking for? The following properties are checked to ensure they have been defined.
info contact Bad example info: title: Chicken Nuggets Inc.</description></item><item><title>info-description</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/info-description/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/info-description/</guid><description>JSON Path: $.info The Info Object should always have a description defined.
Think about the kind of questions that someone consuming the contract would want to know. A description should try to answer questions like:
What is this API contract about? Why does it exist? Why should I use it? Who built it? Where can I learn more? Why did this violation appear? There is no description defined in the info object.</description></item><item><title>info-license</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/info-license/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/info-license/</guid><description>JSON Path: $.info The Info Object should have a license defined.
What is a license for? It helps consumers of the API understand how it can be used when consumed for commercial purposes. To help choose a license, Choose A License can help.
A License Object has two properties.
name url Why did this violation appear? There is no license object defined as part of the info object. The info object may also be missing entirely.</description></item><item><title>license-url</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/license-url/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/information/license-url/</guid><description>JSON Path: $.info.license A License Object should have a url defined.
