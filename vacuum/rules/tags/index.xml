Tags are used as navigation/taxonomy meta-data for documentation and code generation tooling. Descriptions are really important for consumers.
Why did this violation appear? One or more global tags does not contain a description
Bad example openapi: 3.0.1 tags: - name: &amp;#34;Tag1&amp;#34; - name: &amp;#34;Tag2&amp;#34; info: ... Good Example openapi: 3.0.1 tags: - name: &amp;#34;Tag1&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Tag1 is a tag for group 1, and related things&amp;#34; - name: &amp;#34;Tag2&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Tag2 is a tag for group 2, which is only for one thing.</description></item><item><title>operation-tags</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/operation-tags/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 04:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/operation-tags/</guid><description>Operations make use of Tags to group operations together. Tags are really important for documentation and exploring tools.
This rule checks that an operation has defined tags, and that at least one exists. This rule is a more generic and more useful version of the operation-singular-tag.
Why did this violation appear? One or more operation in the specification does not have a tags property that contains at least a single tag.</description></item><item><title>openapi-tags</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/openapi-tags/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/openapi-tags/</guid><description>Global Tags define meta-data that can then be used by Operations and Paths Rules
Why did this violation appear? Global tags have not been defined, or they are not an array as required by the schema.
Bad examples No tags defined
openapi: 3.0.1 info: description: &amp;#34;This is a specification&amp;#34; paths: /some/path: ... Tags are not an array
openapi: 3.0.1 tags: name: &amp;#34;Tag&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;I am a description&amp;#34; info: description: &amp;#34;This is a specification&amp;#34; paths: /some/path: .</description></item><item><title>openapi-tags-alphabetical</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/openapi-tags-alphabetical/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/openapi-tags-alphabetical/</guid><description>JSON Path: $.tags If you want to ensure readability for humans, it can make things much easier to read if tags are listed alphabetically.
Why did this violation appear? Global tags are not listed alphabetically for one or more operations.
Bad example tags: - name: &amp;#34;Nuggets&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Chicken nuggets&amp;#34; - name: &amp;#34;Apples&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Apples are great&amp;#34; Good Example tags: - name: &amp;#34;Apples&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Apples are great&amp;#34; - name: &amp;#34;Nuggets&amp;#34; description: &amp;#34;Chicken nuggets&amp;#34; How do I fix this violation?</description></item><item><title>operation-singular-tag</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/operation-singular-tag/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/operation-singular-tag/</guid><description>Operation Tags are used to define operation categories or groups.
Tools use tags differently when generating code, or documentation. Sometimes, multiple tags can interfere with how tools operate.
To be honest, this rule is a bit obscure, generally it&amp;rsquo;s not recommended unless there is a specific use case for it.
Why did this violation appear? Multiple tags have been used in an operation.
What is this rule checking for? Every Operation is only allowed a single tag to be defined</description></item><item><title>operation-tag-defined</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/operation-tag-defined/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/tags/operation-tag-defined/</guid><description>Operation Tags are used to define operation categories or groups.
Sometimes, tags that have been defined for an operation, have not been defined as part of the global scope of the specification.
Why did this violation appear? A tag was used in an operation, without that tag being defined in the global scope.
What is this rule checking for? Every Operation has to use tags that have been declared globally as part of the tags definition.</description></item></channel></rss>
