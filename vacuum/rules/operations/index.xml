An operation isn&amp;rsquo;t much use, unless it returns an OK status code (2xx), or a Redirect/Choice status code (3xx)
Why did this violation appear? There is an Operation Response in your specification that isn&amp;rsquo;t returning a success response.
What is this rule checking for? Every Operation Response is checked for the following:
2xx or 3xx Response code A good example.</description></item><item><title>operation-operationId</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/operations/operation-operationid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/operations/operation-operationid/</guid><description>Every operation must have an operationId. It&amp;rsquo;s critical that all Operation&amp;rsquo;s have an identifier.
An operationId is used by documentation tools, code generators and mocking engines. It&amp;rsquo;s used to define page names, URI&amp;rsquo;s and method names in auto-generated code.
Why did this violation appear? There is an Operation in your specification that has not defined an operationId.

It&amp;rsquo;s critical that all Operation&amp;rsquo;s can be identified independently, without the need to analyze the path, params and verbs to locate an operation.
An operationId is used by documentation tools, code generators and mocking engines. It&amp;rsquo;s used to define page names, URI&amp;rsquo;s and method names in auto-generated code.
It needs to be unique so there are no clashes with other operations (nothing else can share that ID).</description></item><item><title>operation-parameters</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/operations/operation-parameters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/operations/operation-parameters/</guid><description>Operation Parameters can be described through paths, headers cookies and queries.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to ensure that none of these parameters are duplicates, which is easier that you may think, when an operation has multiple parameter definitions across different types.
Why did this violation appear? There is a Parameter in the specification that has been duplicated or it&amp;rsquo;s using multiple input types

Tools use tags differently when generating code, or documentation. Sometimes, multiple tags can interfere with how tools operate.
To be honest, this rule is a bit obscure, generally it&amp;rsquo;s not recommended unless there is a specific use case for it.
Why did this violation appear? Multiple tags have been used in an operation.
What is this rule checking for? Every Operation is only allowed a single tag to be defined</description></item><item><title>operation-tag-defined</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/operations/operation-tag-defined/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/operations/operation-tag-defined/</guid><description>Operation Tags are used to define operation categories or groups.
Sometimes, tags that have been defined for an operation, have not been defined as part of the global scope of the specification.
Why did this violation appear? A tag was used in an operation, without that tag being defined in the global scope.
What is this rule checking for? Every Operation has to use tags that have been declared globally as part of the tags definition.</description></item><item><title>path-params</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/operations/path-params/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 15:53:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/operations/path-params/</guid><description>Path Parameters are pretty easy to get wrong.
Sometimes, they can be defined, but never used, or used but never defined. Sometimes they are duplicated, or set to required, but then are not defined.
There is a whole raft of issues that can appear with Path Parameters, so this rule is one of the more complex ones.
Why did this violation appear? An operation has used path parameters, but has incorrectly implemented them.</description></item></channel></rss>
