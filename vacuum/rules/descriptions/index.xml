This rule checks that for every component there is a description set.
Why did this violation appear? One or more description elements in the spec are missing from a component (v3+)
Bad example components: schemas: ChickenNugget: type: object properties: id: type: integer name: type: string Good example components: schemas: ChickenNugget: type: object description: &amp;#34;This represents a chicken nugget, used for all kinds of nugget fun.</description></item><item><title>description-duplication</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/description-duplication/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 05:59:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/description-duplication/</guid><description>Descriptions are really important. Often, contract authors copy and paste a lot. This it because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to copy and paste things and modify them, rather than typing out a bunch of YAML or JSON.
The problem with copy and pasting for contracts should be clear. Duplication of content is everywhere, including descriptions. This is really un-helpful for anyone trying to understand a contract, not to mention creating a really poor experience for documentation users.</description></item><item><title>oas3-parameter-description</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/oas3-parameter-description/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 07:59:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/oas3-parameter-description/</guid><description>This rule checks that Parameters contain a description.
Descriptions for parameters are really important. Documentation generation tools use this description as the main bulk of the documentation for describing what a parameter does and its effect.
It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how often API authors leave this blank or don&amp;rsquo;t put anything meaningful in here.
Why did this violation appear? One Parameter or more are missing a description.
Bad example paths: /chicken/nuggets/{nuggetId}: get: summary: &amp;#34;Get a chicken nugget by ID&amp;#34; parameters: - in: path name: nuggetId schema: type: integer required: true .</description></item><item><title>oas2-parameter-description</title><link>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/oas2-parameter-description/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 07:58:17 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://quobix.com/vacuum/rules/descriptions/oas2-parameter-description/</guid><description>This rule checks that Parameters contain a description.

Descriptions and summaries for operations are really important. Documentation generation tools use this description as the main bulk of the documentation for the operation.
It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how often API authors leave this blank or don&amp;rsquo;t put anything meaningful in here.
The reason why both description and summary are checked? People tend to use them differently, sometimes omitting one, or the other, depending on how the specification is used.</description></item></channel></rss>
