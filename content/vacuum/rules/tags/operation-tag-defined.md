[Operation Tags](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/grouping-operations-with-tags/) are used to define operation _categories_ or _groups_.

Sometimes, tags that have been defined for an operation, have **not** been defined as part of the global scope of the specification. 

### Why did this violation appear?

A tag was used in an operation, without that tag being defined in the global scope. 

### What is this rule checking for?

Every [Operation](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) has to use tags that have been declared globally as part of the 
[tags](https://swagger.io/specification/#tag-object) definition.

### Bad example

{{< highlight yaml >}}
tags:
  - name: snakes
    description: snakes on a plane?
  - name: cakes
    description: We much prefer cakes on a plane.
paths:
  /snakes/cakes:
  post:
    tags: 
      - someRandomUndefinedTag
{{< /highlight >}}

### Good Example

{{< highlight yaml >}}
tags: 
  - name: snakes
    description: snakes on a plane?
  - name: cakes
    description: We much prefer cakes on a plane.
paths:
  /snakes/cakes:
    post:
      tags: 
        - snakes
        - cakes
{{< /highlight >}}


### How do I fix this violation?

Make sure that any tags used by an operation, have been globally declared in the specification [tags](https://swagger.io/specification/#tag-object) definition.
