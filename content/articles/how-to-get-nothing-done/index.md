## A day in the life

**_Finally_**, I have a clear afternoon!

It's time to get some actual work done, _finally_! I'm excited about coding and being productive for a change.

My brain is engaged. I am in the zone and in a state of flow. I can see the matrix.

My phone buzzes in my pocket 30 minutes into my session. 

It's a Slack message.

---

Immediately my entire train of thought is interrupted, like a record needle scratching across an in-motion record. 
It feels like an **electric bolt** of annoyance surging through my whole body.

I'm rapidly ejected from my flow state and hurtled back into reality.

> "ARGH, who the fu... why?"

As I switch over to my Slack client, I see a message from a colleague.

> "Hi, quobix..."

No actual message, just a damn "_hello_."

I choose to ignore the message. It can wait.

---

As I flip back to the code, I must re-start my debugger. I am trying to remember where I was, but I need help. 
I forgot what I was doing. I need to ramp back up again. 

**"Bing"**.

In comes an email. A meeting about something just came in. It starts in _twenty minutes_.

> "Why?.. why all these meetings? Do I really need to be in this meeting?"

Annoyed, I flip back to my code.

> "OK, let's focus, go!" 

I tell myself as I attempt to run against the clock. My window just got shorter.

Another ten minutes go by, and my phone buzzes again. 

> "Have you read my architecture documents yet?...."

Thrown **_back out of my flow_** again, I give up.

I only have ten minutes left before my meeting. I need **more time** to do something effectively.

I _can't_ read the docs. I _can't_ code or debug anything worthwhile. This 'real' work.. will have to wait.

## Sound familiar? 

It probably does. Interruptions and disruptions affect us even if we're not coding and doing something else that requires 
focus and concentration.

{{<info-box>}} Interrupts make us **_suck at our jobs_**. They are **why we get nothing done**.{{</info-box>}}

## Greed is good

[The line spoken by Gordon Gekko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AZtk3z5aYM) in 'Wall St" refers to the enduring human 
spirit to always seek more, push us forward, and break new heights as a race.

We all want **more money**. We all want **more time**.

When it comes to money, we can always **_make more_**.

When it comes to time, however, we **_cannot make more_**. 

Everyone has the same amount of time each day â€”precisely **86,400** seconds. If you boil that down to a typical eight
working hours, with an hour for lunch, it's just **25,200** seconds or **420** minutes.

---

As we become more senior in our roles at work, we get more and more responsibilities pushed on us.

More and more Zoom calls, Slack messages, emails, meetings, and individual 1-1 conversations explode into our day.
Our minutes are **_grabbed_** and **_stolen_** from every angle.

_VPs_, _Managers_, _Product Managers_, _Peers_, _Designers_, _Operations_, and _Support_, **everyone wants our time**.

The **_first trick_** to learn is that **greed is good** when it comes to _time_.

## Calendar Defense

Until you reach the lofty heights of an executive role, you probably have to manage your own calendar, just like me. So to become effective in very senior positions - learning to defend your calendar is a must.

Before the week begins...

{{<info-box>}}**BLOCK OUT YOUR OWN TIME**.{{</info-box>}}

**_Book out blocks of hours on your calendar for doing actual work_**. 

Mark yourself as _out-of-office_ if need be and auto-reject all meetings for that period. Embrace a mindset of **being un-available**
during those times when you have **_no meetings_** and **_no other responsibilities_**.

Stop people from **_robbing_** you of your **_own time_**. Be **greedy with your own time**. It is the _only_ time you have.
If it were money, we would all be **_much more protective_** of people trying to grab $100 whenever they felt like it.

Time is money. Protect it like you would your physical assets. Protect your time like you would gold coins.

The second trick to productivity is **_removing interrupts_**.

## Get off the grid

> "The only way to be interrupted is to enable interruption."

I totally made that quote up, but it's true.

To protect our time means to **_defend against interrupts_**, so how do we do that effectively?

{{<info-box>}}**Turn off all the things. Put the phone on work mode.**{{</info-box>}}

Email, Slack, Teams, Zoom, Calendar. **Close all of it**. **_Shut it down_**. 

If it's running, it will distract us. Every ding, bing, bong, and chime will send a **_zap of electricity_** through our 
brain and interrupt any flow state.

When we're in our specially boxed time, we must treat the space inside that box as **sacred**. **_No distractions!_**

That Slack message can wait, and _who reads email anymore anyway_?

We should be free to achieve a flow state in our boxed time. Flow comes from **_immersion_**, and **_immersion_** requires 
**focus**.

{{<card "What is flow?">}}

Have you ever been driving down the road, suddenly realizing you were daydreaming, and **_don't remember_** going the last mile?

Ever been so deeply engrossed in something that time becomes distorted and hours seem to **_fly past in minutes_**?

Both are examples of a [flow state](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/flow-state).

A state of zen, where we can operate with only our subconscious in control (_like the driving example_), 
or we're so interested in something that it becomes a **hyper-focus**, and everything else **_fades out_**.

In a flow state, we unlock our minds and are free to roam and use all the creative potential energy we have locked up. 
Like meditation, it takes **_practice_**, **_focus_**, and **_removing distractions_**.
{{</card>}}

The third trick in our toolkit is **_being brave_** and saying **no**.

## Do I need to be here?

Look at **_all those meetings_** on your calendar. Impressive!

The problem with meetings is that they generally save time for most participants. 
Many are '_group_' meetings, where a **_few people talk_**, and everyone else _listens_.

Every second we **_sit doing nothing_** in a meeting is a second we're **wasting being productive**. 
We need to look at all meetings as **_theft_** of our time.

{{<info-box>}}Ask yourself a question: **_do I need to attend that meeting?_**{{</info-box>}}

Will the project fail?, Will you miss critical data that endangers the product or the company?

The answer is almost always **no**.

We should all feel empowered to use that logic to resist attending every single meeting that gets planted on our calendars.

Be brave, and hit '**reject**.'

{{<info-box>}}Protecting our time by saying no to non-critical meetings is **effective time management**.{{</info-box>}}

These three skills allow us to protect our precious hours from time burglars. When combined, it's how you **get shit done**.

### Block out your time.

**Be greedy**. Book your own time first before anyone else has a chance to steal it. Protect your time like it's literal gold. Don't let anyone steal your gold.

### Get off the grid.

Shut down messaging, shut down email, **shut it all down** except the tools you need to do your work. Put on some music or whatever gets you energized and ready to focus and flow.

### Be brave. Say no.

Reject any meetings that cut through your protected time and **say no to non-critical meetings**. Only show up if you need to be there.
