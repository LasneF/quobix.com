As we knew it, the world stopped operating according to standard operating procedures in 2016.


And then, suddenly, it came to a **complete halt** in 2020.

---
## What happened in 2016?

We reached a boiling point in the west driven by the **_extreme left and right politics_** that dominated media outlets,
mainly social media, and **terrible** cable news networks like [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com) and [CNN](https://www.cnn.com).

The outcome led to events like [Brexit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit) and the
[January 6th Capitol Attack](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/24-months-january-6-attack-capitol) â€” a **pivotal point in history**
for the modern world.

**_None of which is new_**. What happened in 2016 has **happened before**, __many times__, and across the ages.

{{<info-box>}}
But something was a little different this time around.
{{</info-box>}}

## Zero interest rate phenomena.

From 2010 through 2015, the world existed **_outside of reality_**.

Money was essentially **free**, meaning anyone could borrow cash and pay _very little_ interest on the loan.

This rare situation created a distortion bubble in reality. Somehow businesses and companies were valued on growth,
accumulating users, and '[blitzing](https://amzn.to/3Y0uByv)' markets with a saturating presence.

During that period, companies _derived valuation_ came from **growth**. In other words, It was about how quickly
a company could go to market with a product, **saturate the market** with a brand, and operate a
[winner takes all](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winner-take-all_market) strategy to capture the market.

## Stranger things

It was even **_stranger_** than just growth alone.

It seemed that any business that took a traditional, **non**-technical product
(_like a hotel room, taxi, or delivery service_) and wrapped it in a technical solution that **_removed_** having to
talk to people, or it added a sense of higher convenience, exclusivity, and novelty __(mostly novelty)__ over that traditional product.

Everyone suddenly became a bit starstruck by that concept.

> ..."yeah, but - does it have an app?"

---

The product and the end-to-end experience of the product became an **afterthought**.

It was about showcasing how '**disruptive**' a start-up or company was and how it could **dominate** a new market.

[Uber](https://uber.com), [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com), and [Doordash](https://www.doordash.com) market themselves as
the _re-invention_ or **_disruption_** of Taxis, Logistics, Hotels, and Takeout food.

They all took [Reid Hoffman's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman) '[Blitzscaling](https://amzn.to/3Y0uByv)'
approach to business. It worked like **nothing** we had ever seen during that magical time.

By the time 2016 rolled around, however, everyone wanted a slice of the pie. The money was **_everywhere_**,
and it was **free**.


## Peak noise-to-signal ratio


Social Media was a hive of insanity (_not that it's much better today, but wow, back then, Facebook was a cesspit_)

We saw the rise of concepts like [flat-earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth) and [Qanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon).
Utterly insane ideas generally relegated to the internet's darkest corners were **_suddenly shoved in everyone's faces_**.

Truth suddenly became an opinion. Somehow **logic** and **reason** started leaking out of reality.

We didn't know it then, but this is where **_things tipped_**. We were about to experience a taste of the new world ahead of us.

## Wiping off the groceries

In 2020, the world **froze**, and we all experienced something new (_[well, for most of us under the age of 100](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/1918-pandemic-history.htm)_).

The pandemic **changed our lives completely**.

All of a sudden, we found ourselves wearing masks everywhere. Stores were closed, lockdowns were in place,
**_alien_** concepts to most of us in the 'free' world.

{{<error-box>}}
I remember standing in the kitchen, **wiping off the delivery groceries with disinfectant and a mask** to protect my family from the dangerous virus.
{{</error-box>}}

> I have since had COVID twice, as has my entire family. We no longer fear the virus; none of us should.

---

As this was all unfolding, something akin to a [bull trap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bulltrap.asp) was going on,
unlike anything we had seen before. All of this was new territory for everyone.

{{<info-box>}} Tech was going **insane**! {{</info-box>}}

Valuations for internet-based companies went through the charts, [Peloton went to the moon](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354113820_Peloton's_ride_to_growth)
and so did others like [zoom](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/zooms-stock-surges-41percent-on-earnings-adding-over-37-billion-in-value.html).
Any company that enabled remote operations or engagement benefited from the bounty bubble.

Governments worldwide pumped even **MORE** [free cash into people's hands](https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan).

{{<info-box>}}MOAR **FREE MONEY** FOR EVERYONE{{</info-box>}}


Tech CEOs convinced the world that remote work was the future for everyone (It isn't, and **_won't be_**),
and everyone would love video-conferencing from home all day (we don't. We **mostly hate it**).

What a time to be in tech, right?

## Cash drunk at the end of the world

In 2021, we were [partying like it was 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble). And then, just like in 2000,
we saw the [bubble pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_bubble).

---

## Here we go again

2022 was [one of the worst, if not the worst, year in history](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/one-question-looms-about-where-tech-stocks-go-now-after-one-of-their-worst-years-on-record-11672361520)
for technology companies.

Silicon Valley went through another bubble pop, this time affecting tens of thousands of tech workers, in a [bloodbath
of a layoff](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-11659373/Tech-jobs-bloodbath-rockets-200-000.html)
as a result of the re-balancing of the system. It's not over yet and as of writing, is still in motion.

The alternate reality we saw from 2020-2022, was being un-made, and it was also the start of a [regression toward the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean),
**not just for tech** but for __planet earth__.

It seems now that people are getting upset with being [charged crazy fees](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/o2dgag/current_pricingcrazy/)
to stay in someone else's house and be asked to [mow the lawn and take home garbage](https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnb-chores-cleaning-fee-11663269029)
as part of the deal.

People are re-discovering novel concepts like [paying a business for a fully serviced room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel),
with complete freedom to come and go, with no strings attached.

Re-discovering that hotels are pretty convenient and that a taxi is often a more reliable and convenient way to travel
instead of a ride-share application means that the industry is (like with everything) [regressing toward the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean).

The pandemic was a **catalyst** for what was **_already happening across the globe_**.

{{< inline-figure-thin "*toilet-paper*" "Toilet paper was a hot commodity" "A stack of rolls of toilet paper and unicorn sitting next to them" >}}

We **all** experienced supply chain interruption, and I specifically remember worrying about **_toilet paper and paper towels_**.

{{<error-box>}}
**Never** in my life have I had to worry about **_toilet paper_**.
{{</error-box>}}

The more significant shift was how [globalization was fracturing and turning inward](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/10/05/in-u-s-and-uk-globalization-leaves-some-feeling-left-behind-or-swept-up/).
[Globalization was over](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/31/business/supply-chain-small-business.html),
and in February 2022, we saw the nasty side of what happens when countries become inward-focused with the [invasion of Ukraine by Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine).

This side of us, humanity, **isn't new**, not at all. We have [seen this all before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland),
[many times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conflicts_in_Europe).

The last time the world was in this position was the
[period leading up to the second world war in 1939](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/world-war-ii-history).

What we experienced from 1945-2020 was **abnormal**. Starting with the [Post-World War Two economic boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion)
and bumping along through various recessions, and ending with a [second big boom](https://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/tracking-the-post-great-recession-economy)
that came to an abrupt halt by COVID-19.

## The golden years of globalization

The forty-year period from 1980-2020 and the rise of globalization on a scale _never seen_ before in human history was a **golden moment** for us.

However, like everything, like always - we're reverting to the mean. That world has ended, and we're entering the next phase of our journey.
The geopolitical climate we're now in means [international trade is changing](https://hbr.org/2022/04/the-state-of-globalization-in-2022) and
market definition of value is also **_changing_**.

[Free Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecashflow.asp) (_FCF_) is now the [marker of health used by the
stock market to determine value](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/success-in-the-m-and-a-rebound-riding-the-coming-wave-of-upstream-deals),
and valuation is no longer rooted in how fast a company can grow or how many customers it can acquire.

Now it's all about [free cash flow](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/01/26/if-cash-is-king-these-nasdaq-stocks-reign-supreme/)
through revenue, and cash-generating businesses are __where the market wants to invest__.

People want **products**, they expect **high quality** and **choice** that is available **locally**
.

---

## Local first is the new hotness

Manufacturing, logistics, farming, industry, engineering, medicine, high-tech, and any company that produces consumed
products (**_food, medicine, equipment, tools, software_**) will see a **bountiful future.**

The time of **_free money_** is over, and a massive **supply vs. demand** problem will open up everywhere.
International trade and supply will become _more complicated_ and **_fragmented globally__*,
so **local production** will become the new normal (_again_).

The same [local-first trend is also emerging in software development](https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf).

The _somewhat similar_ concept of '**_always needing cloud access_**' (which breaks our offline experience significantly) is close
to the idea of '**_needing access to global trade_**' to meet supply chain needs.

All this change boils down to something I believe in my core;

{{<success-box>}}
The following 10-15 years will be a **new golden age** for those who _build_ things.
{{</success-box>}}

## Rise of the builder.

So **_what do we do_** about this change?

I have one word for you. **BUILD**!

Building **_high-quality, consumable, usable_** products that are readily available locally or nationally
will be **extraordinarily valuable** between now and 2040.

If you're a builder, **go faster**! **_Tick-tock_** goes the clock!

Now is the time to put the **_pedal to the metal_** and go **harder than ever**. The bounty awaits.

To learn more, I recommend '[The end of the world is just the beginning](https://amzn.to/3Z3w1cX)' by Peter Zeihan.

### If you're not a builder

What would you build? What is stopping you? Do you want to miss out? Are you happy just consuming?

Do you **_want to miss_** this wave of prosperity?

Take advantage of this opportunity. **Build something**.
