**Hi, My name is quobix.[^1]**

I'm a hacker, product guy, software architect, inventor, technical leader, and [failed musician.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3GQKa1b5anj2SX4km56oPN)

I have about twenty-five years of experience with designing and building software and software products across various industries and businesses.

My specialty is **Experience Engineering**, which _generally means_ that I design and build technology that you **_engage with_** as a consumer.

I work as a **Distinguished Engineer** at [Splunk](https://splunk.com)

## Making complex things feel simple and intuitive.

My **ultimate goal**, Creating the **_big red 'easy' button_**.

The easy button means abstracting away a lot of different technological complexities.

All those complexities are **pretty cool** because it means I get to touch a lot of *fast-moving* tech. 

I _generally_ specialize in UI, CLI, API, and developer experience (DX); however, I've designed and built across a **large landscape**. 

I've had the pleasure of architecting and building multiple platforms, SaaS products, developer tools, frameworks, games, and enterprise-scale management systems.

I am also the founder (and chief buckaroo) of [princess beef heavy industries](https://pb33f.io).
